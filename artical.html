          <div ><h1>This smart power strip lets you individually control each outlet</h1></div>
            <div class="img"><img src="img/smart.png" width="400px" height="200px"></div>
     <div> There are an endless number of smart plugs that let you remotely turn an outlet on and off, but those plugs usually accept just one single cable. So to address bigger needs, Kasa is introducing an entire smart power strip that allows you to individually control all six of its power sockets.

The Kasa Smart Wi-Fi Power Strip has six power sockets, which can be controlled through an app or by voice assistants, as well as three USB ports that always remain powered on. Kasa, which comes from the router company TP-Link, is far from the first to make a smart power strip, but it is perhaps the first major brand to do so. And given that, when it comes to power strips, you really want to buy from a legitimate brand, that makes this announcement a notable one.

On top of that, Kasa’s line of smart home products actually work, and its app is fairly easy to use. Once you have the power strip set up, you’ll be able to assign different icons to each socket, so that you can identify what’s plugged into them — be it a computer, a fan, a lamp, or something else. The app also integrates with Alexa, the Google Assistant, and Cortana, so you can control the sockets by voice. Kasa says that it’s working on HomeKit support as well but doesn’t have a date for when it’ll be ready.

The strip’s three USB ports can’t be turned off, which seems fine since those are probably going to be charging gadgets or else sitting unused. Unfortunately, the ports max out at 4 amps, which means they won’t be able to fast charge any smartphones, which is really what you’d want to use them for. I’m sure some USB ports could still come in handy for other purposes, but I suspect anyone who’s nerdy enough to buy this product will also be the kind of person who wants to use a power adapter that supports fast charging, which is going to take up a socket.

Another benefit here is that the whole thing connects to your home network over Wi-Fi, so you don’t need some other hub or smart speaker in order to start using it. I have a couple of smart plugs in my home (both from Kasa) so I very much understand the use for them, but I do have to wonder: how many people will need to remotely control more than one or two things connected to the same power strip? I’m not sure who has that many lamps, fans, and other objects that would benefit from remote control in the exact same place.

The power strip launches today for $80. That’s a lot more expensive than a normal power strip, but compared to the price of a single smart plug — Kasa’s goes for around $25 — the price looks more reasonable.

            <div class="img"><img src="img/one.png" width="400px" height="200px"></div>
     <div> Finally! OnePlus has just announced the product that so many Android phone users have been crying out for for many months: cheap, yet high-quality USB-C earphones to replace the analog ones we can no longer use with our phones that are deprived of headphone jacks.

The new OnePlus Type-C Bullets are an upgraded version of the very good Bullets Wireless that I reviewed back in 2016. The Bullets v2 were priced at $19.99, and OnePlus promises to keep the price unchanged with its new USB-C edition, while adding a few design and feature updates. The Type-C Bullets will come with a built-in Cirrus Logic DAC, which should make them compatible with most USB-C devices, including laptops and tablets. They’ll also have a built-in microphone and remote control.

OnePlus says it’ll release the new Bullets at the same time as its next flagship, which we already know will be called the OnePlus 6T and will feature a fingerprint reader built into the display. The specific timing of the release hasn’t yet been announced, but if OnePlus keeps to its traditional calendar, both the OnePlus 6T and the Type-C Bullets should be available to buy sometime this November, if not sooner.

          <div ><h1>Edward Snowden surveillance powers ruled unlawful</h1></div>
            <div class="img"><img src="img/snowden.jpg" width="400px" height="200px"></div>
     <div> The UK's bulk interception powers, exposed by the whistleblower Edward Snowden, have been found to be illegal by the European Court of Human Rights.

In a landmark judgement, the court ruled agencies had violated rights as there were no proper safeguards.

The court crucially said bulk interception was legitimate and it had seen no evidence it had been abused.

Parliament reformed surveillance powers in 2016 and introduced a new watchdog. Critics say the system is still flawed.
         What were the powers being challenged in court?
In 2013, Edward Snowden revealed that GCHQ - the UK's eavesdropping agency - had been secretly collecting communications sent over the internet on an industrial scale.

It could reassemble the communications, filter them and then analyse the remainder for anything useful to protecting national security.

Bulk surveillance programmes revealed:

"Tempora" - the bulk storage of all internet traffic GCHQ could harvest
"Karma Police" - an attempt to catalogue the web habits of any user who could be found
"Black Hole" - a digital library of more than one trillion internet "events"
The agency could also obtain data and content from its US partners and companies including Apple, Google and Facebook.

Campaigners argued that these collection systems violated the right to privacy - and on Thursday the European Court of Human Rights agreed.

What did the court say?
The judgement said the system revealed by Mr Snowden simply did not have any proper safeguards because it led to completely "untargeted" collection of information.

In practice, this meant personal information could be seen by GCHQ, even if it had nothing to do with national security threats.

The judgement said: "While there is no evidence to suggest that the intelligence services are abusing their powers - on the contrary, the [then British watchdog] observed that the selection procedure was carefully and conscientiously undertaken by analysts, the court is not persuaded that the safeguards governing selection of bearers [internet cables] for interception and the selection of intercepted material for examination are sufficiently robust to provide adequate guarantees against abuse.

"Of greatest concern, however, is the absence of robust independent oversight of the selectors and search criteria used to filter intercepted communications."
